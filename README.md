# Building an Analytics Framework for Liquor Vendor

This is a 3 part project where I build an analytics framework for a liquor vendor. In Part 1, I use RFM Analysis to segment customers and understand their purchasing habits. In Part 2 I create a forecast for the business using machine learning techniques. In Part 3 (yet to come), I will use machine learning to predict if a customer will make a purchase in the next coming days, and how much they will spend. 

Detail write up on Part 1 is available [here](https://lucasoblog.netlify.app/project/rfm-analysis-for-liquor-sales/), while detailed write up on Part 2 is available [here](https://lucasoblog.netlify.app/project/forecasting-for-liquor-sales/)
